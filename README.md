## 📖 Project Overview

This Business Intelligence project was developed in **Power BI** using the **TMDB (The Movie Database)** dataset, with preliminary exploration and data preparation performed in **SQL**.

The dashboard provides a structured analysis of the movie industry, with a focus on:

- **profitability**
- **revenue performance**
- **market trends over time**
- **genre analysis**
- **rating impact**
- **actors and directors contribution**

The goal is to transform raw movie data into actionable insights through interactive dashboards, KPI monitoring, and visual storytelling.

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives

This project was designed to answer key business questions such as:

- Which movies generate the highest profit?
- How does **budget** affect **revenue** and **profitability**?
- Is there a relationship between **rating** and **ROI**?
- Which genres perform best in economic terms?
- How much do actors and directors influence movie success?
- What trends can be identified across the years?

---

## 📊 Key Metrics Monitored

The dashboard tracks the most relevant performance indicators, including:

- **Total Profit**
- **Total Revenue**
- **Average Profit per Movie**
- **ROI (Return on Investment)**
- **Profit Margin (%)**
- **Average Rating**
- **Total Number of Movies**

---

## 🗄️ Data Preparation & SQL Analysis

Before building the Power BI dashboard, an exploratory SQL phase was carried out to validate the dataset, define metrics, and prepare the data model.

### Main SQL analyses performed

- total movie count
- movie distribution by year
- top movies by revenue and profit
- average rating by movie and genre
- percentage of profitable movies
- number of movies by genre
- top actors and directors by production volume
- movies with budget above average

This phase helped define the analytical framework later implemented in Power BI.
